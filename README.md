# DebugLogging

Unobtrusive, inheritable-overridable-configurable, drop-in debug logging, that won't leave a mess behind when it is time to remove it.

### Gives you (all are optional):

* *benchmarking*
* *colorization by class/method*
* *robust argument printer with customizable ellipsis*
* *unique invocation identifiers*
* *single line config, per class/instance/method config*
* *separate logger, if needed*
* *log method calls, also when exit scope*
* *Prevents heavy computation of strings with `logger.debug { 'log me' }` block format.*

* *Optional instance variable logging*
* **so many free ponies** üé†üê¥üé†üê¥üé†üê¥

## Next Level Magic

Herein you will find:

* Classes inheriting from Module
* Zero tolerance policy on monkey patching
* 100% clean, 0% obtrusive
* 100% tested
* 100% Ruby 2.1+ compatible
  - use version ~1.0 for Ruby < 2.3
  - use version ~2.0 for Ruby 2.3
  - use version ~3.0 for Ruby 2.4+

NOTE: The manner this is made to work for class methods is totally different than the way this is made to work for instance methods.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'debug_logging'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install debug_logging

## Usage

NOTE: Starting with version `1.0.12` this gem utilizes the `logger.debug { "block format" }` to avoid heavy debug processing when the log level threshold is set higher than the level of the statements produced as a result of the configuration of this gem.

Crack open the specs for more complex usage examples than the ones below.

### Without Rails

It just works. ;)
Configuration can go anywhere you want.  Configuration is the same regardless; see below.

### With Rails

Recommend creating `config/initializers/debug_logging.rb`, or adding to `config/application.rb` with:

```ruby
# Showing the defaults
DebugLogging.configuration.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # you probably want to override to be the Rails.logger, and if so you can't set it in the initializer, as it needs to be set after Rails.logger is set.
DebugLogging.configuration.log_level = :debug # at what level do the messages created by this gem sent at?
DebugLogging.configuration.multiple_last_hashes = false # pass every hash argument to last_hash_to_s_proc?
DebugLogging.configuration.last_hash_to_s_proc = nil # e.g. ->(hash) { "keys: #{hash.keys}" }
DebugLogging.configuration.last_hash_max_length = 1_000
DebugLogging.configuration.args_max_length = 1_000
DebugLogging.configuration.instance_benchmarks = false
DebugLogging.configuration.class_benchmarks = false
DebugLogging.configuration.active_support_notifications = false
DebugLogging.configuration.colorized_chain_for_method = false # e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.red.on_blue.underline }
DebugLogging.configuration.colorized_chain_for_class = false # e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.colorize(:light_blue ).colorize( :background => :red) }
DebugLogging.configuration.add_invocation_id = true # identify a method call uniquely in a log, pass a proc for colorization, e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.light_black }
DebugLogging.configuration.ellipsis = " ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚Ä¶".freeze
DebugLogging.configuration.mark_scope_exit = true # Only has an effect if benchmarking is off, since benchmarking always marks the scope exit
```

If you prefer to use the block style:

```ruby
DebugLogging.configure do |config|
  config.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT) # probably want to override to be the Rails.logger, and if so you can't set it in the initializer, as it needs to be set after Rails.logger is set.
  config.log_level = :debug # at what level do the messages created by this gem sent at?
  config.multiple_last_hashes = false # pass every hash argument to last_hash_to_s_proc?
  config.last_hash_to_s_proc = nil # e.g. ->(hash) { "keys: #{hash.keys}" }
  config.last_hash_max_length = 1_000
  config.args_max_length = 1_000
  config.instance_benchmarks = false
  config.class_benchmarks = false
  config.active_support_notifications = false
  config.colorized_chain_for_method = false # e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.red.on_blue.underline }
  config.colorized_chain_for_class = false # e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.colorize(:light_blue ).colorize( :background => :red) }
  config.add_invocation_id = true # identify a method call uniquely in a log, pass a proc for colorization, e.g. ->(colorized_string) { colorized_string.light_black }
  config.ellipsis = " ‚úÇÔ∏è ‚Ä¶".freeze
  config.mark_scope_exit = true # Only has an effect if benchmarking is off, since benchmarking always marks the scope exit
end
```

**All** of the above **config** is **inheritable** and **configurable** at the **per-class** level as well!
Just prepend `debug_` to any config value you want to override in a class.

**All** of the above **config** is **inheritable** and **configurable** at the **per-instance** level as well!
Just prepend `debug_` to any config value you want to override on an instance of a class.

**All** of the above **config** is **inheritable** and **configurable** at the **per-method** level as well!
Just send along a hash of the config options when you call `logged` or `include DebugLogging::InstanceLogger.new(i_methods: [:drive, :stop], config: { ellipsis: " ‚úÇÔ∏è 2 much" })`.  See the example class below, and the specs.

**NOTE ON** `Rails.logger` - It will probably be nil in your initializer, so setting the `config.logger` to `Rails.logger` there will result in setting it to `nil`, which means the default will end up being used: `Logger.new(STDOUT)`. Instead just config the logger in your application.rb, or anytime later, but *before your classes get loaded* and start inheriting the config:

```ruby
DebugLogging.configuration.logger = Rails.logger
```

Every time a method is called, you can now get logs, optionally with arguments, a benchmark, and a unique invocation identifier:

```ruby
class Car

  # adds the helper methods to the class, all are prefixed with debug_*,
  #   except for the logged class method, which comes from extending DebugLogging::ClassLogger
  extend DebugLogging

  # per class configuration overrides!
  self.debug_class_benchmarks = true
  self.debug_instance_benchmarks = true

  # For instance methods:
  # Option 1: specify the exact method(s) to add logging to
  include DebugLogging::InstanceLogger.new(i_methods: [:drive, :stop])

  # Provides the `logged` method decorator
  extend DebugLogging::ClassLogger

  logged def make; new; end
  def design(*args); new; end
  def safety(*args); new; end
  def dealer_options(*args); new; end
  logged :design, :safety
  # override options for any instance method(s), by passing a hash as the last argument
  logged :dealer_options, { multiple_last_hashes: true }

  def drive(speed); speed; end
  def stop(**opts); 0; end

  # For instance methods:
  # Option 2: add logging to all instance methods defined above (but *not* defined below)
  include DebugLogging::InstanceLogger.new(i_methods: self.instance_methods(false))

  # override options for any instance method(s)
  include DebugLogging::InstanceLogger.new(i_methods: [:stop], config: { multiple_last_hashes: true })

  def will_not_be_logged; false; end

end
```

### ActiveSupport::Notifications integration

To use `ActiveSupport::Notifications` integration, enable `active_support_notifications` in the config, either single line or block style:

```ruby
DebugLogging.configuration.active_support_notifications = true
```

or

```ruby
DebugLogging.configure do |config|
  config.active_support_notifications = true
end
```

Every time a method is called, class and instance method events are instrumented, consumed and logged:

```ruby
class Car

  # adds the helper methods to the class, all are prefixed with debug_*,
  #   except for the instrumented class method, which comes from extending DebugLogging::ClassNotifier
  extend DebugLogging

  # For instance methods:
  # Option 1: specify the exact method(s) to add instrumentation to (including capturing instance variable values as part of the event payload)
  include DebugLogging::InstanceNotifier.new(i_methods: [:drive,
                                                         :stop,
                                                         [:turn, { instance_variables: %i[direction angle] }]])

  # Provides the `notifies` method decorator
  extend DebugLogging::ClassNotifier

  notifies def make; new; end
  def design(*args); new; end
  def safety(*args); new; end
  def dealer_options(*args); new; end
  notifies :design, :safety
  # adding additional event payload options for any instance method(s), by passing a hash as the last argument
  notifies :dealer_options, { sport_package: true }

  def drive(speed); speed; end
  def stop(**opts); 0; end

  # For instance methods:
  # Option 2: add instrumentation to all instance methods defined above (but *not* defined below)
  include DebugLogging::InstanceNotifier.new(i_methods: self.instance_methods(false))

  def will_not_be_logged; false; end

end
```

## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically,
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint](http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16#page74) with two digits of precision.

For example:

```ruby
spec.add_dependency 'debug_logging', '~> 3.0'
```
